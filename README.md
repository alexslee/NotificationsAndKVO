# NotificationsAndKVO
This example app consists of three exercises, meant as practice for NSNotificationCenter and key-value observing:

1. Creating a Custom NSNotification With a userInfo Dictionary
 * posting & observing an NSNotification in one tabbed view controller, to trigger a display update in another
2. NSNotificationCenter System Events
 * reacting to iOS' keyboard notifications, shifting views to remain visible despite the keyboard popping up on the screen.
3. Observing State Changes Using KVO
 * moving one view in response to another view being dragged around the screen by the user
